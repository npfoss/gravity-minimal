# gravity-minimal

Minimal client for interacting with the Gravity social network from the browser. Mostly for testing purposes.

Source code is in `src/app.js`, `public/index.html`, and `public/app.css`.


*NOTE*: for now, requires [`gravity-protocol`](https://github.com/npfoss/gravity-protocol/) in sibling directory because that isn't a stable npm package yet.

# install
