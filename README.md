# gravity-minimal

Minimal example app for interacting with the Gravity social network.
Runs a full-fledged node in the network, all inside your browser.

Exists primarily for testing purposes and as a working example of how to use the [Gravity protocol](https://github.com/npfoss/gravity-protocol).

Source code is in `src/app.js`, `public/index.html`, and `public/app.css`.
